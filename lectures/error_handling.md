When writing C++ code, much like in life, we don‚Äôt always get what we want. The good news is that we can prepare for this and recover from not getting what we want!

But, just like with everything else in C++, there are‚Ä¶ a lot of ways to do that. üòÖ

Today we‚Äôre talking about error handling. What options we have, which trade-offs they come with, and what tools modern C++ gives us to make our lives a bit easier.

And as this topic is quite nuanced, there will definitely be some statements that are quite opinionated and I can already see some people with pitchforks coming my way... so... I'm sure it's gonna be fun!

<!-- Add a video from shreck? -->

# Disclaimer

This is definitely *not* a one-size-fits-all topic. C++ is huge, powerful, and used across every domain imaginable for a long-long time.

*My* perspective comes from domains like robotics and automotive‚Äîwhere predictability and safety are of highest importance. What works for us may not work for everyone.

That being said, I believe that what we talk about here will fit many other domains with minimal adaptation and is grounded in sane reasoning. Where possible, I‚Äôll try to mention multiple possible options and if I *do* miss an important one‚Äîplease let me know!

# What Do We Mean by ‚ÄúError‚Äù?

Before we go into how to handle errors, let‚Äôs clarify what we mean when we say "error" in the first place.

At the highest level: an error is something that happens when the code doesn‚Äôt produce the result we expect. But there is nuance here!

I tend to think of errors belonging to one of two broad groups:

- **Unrecoverable errors** ‚Äî where the program reaches a state where recovery is impossible or meaningless.
- **Recoverable errors** ‚Äî where the program can detect that something went wrong, and has ways to proceed following an alternative path.

Some languages‚Äîlike Rust‚Äîbake this distinction [into the language design](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html). C++ doesn‚Äôt, making the topic of error handling slightly more nuanced.

But, for my money, this classification is still useful. So let's talk a bit more in-depth about these kinds of errors and I hope that you'll agree with, or at least accept my logic by the end of it.

# Unrecoverable errors: **fail early**

## Intro to unrecoverable errors

Let‚Äôs start with the errors we don‚Äôt want to recover from.

These usually come from programming bugs: a violated precondition, accessing something that shouldn‚Äôt be accessed, or hitting undefined behavior.

In all of these cases the program is typically already in some unknown or unexpected state, so we have no guarantees on anything that happens next. For all we know, our memory might have already been corrupted, which means that recovery is most likely impossible and we are probably better off not even trying to recover.

## Setting up an example

Let us illustrate this with an example. Let's say we have a task to assign robots to missions. For simplicity, we will just typedef our `Robot` and `Mission` class to `int` but they can, of course, be arbitrary types.

`types.hpp`

```cpp
#pragma once

// Can be arbitrary types, here int for simplicity.
using Robot = int;
using Mission = int;
```

We can model the assignment of robots to missions by a class `MissionRobotAssignments` that holds a vector of missions and a vector of robots. It supports a way to assign a new robot to a mission through the `AssignRobot` function and has a convenient `Print` function. In this example, we use a `struct` for keeping the amount of code on the screen manageable, but it should probably be a class, please feel free to refresh why in the video on [classes](classes_intro.md) from before.

`mission_robot_assignments.hpp`

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "types.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// This should be a class, using struct for simplicity.
struct MissionRobotAssignments {

  void AssignRobot(int assignment_index, const Robot& robot) {
    robots[assignment_index] = robot;
  }

  void Print() const {
    for (auto i = 0UL; i < robots.size(); ++i) {
      std::cout << i << ": Mission " <<                      //
          missions[i] << " is carried out by the robot " <<  //
          robots[i] << std::endl;
    }
  }

  std::vector<Mission> missions{};
  std::vector<Robot> robots{};
};
```

For the sake of our example, we let the user modify these assignments manually. We would need some more functions for this. More concretely, we have a function `CheckIfUserWantsChanges` that asks the user if they want to make any changes and returns a boolean value that indicates their answer.

In addition to this, we need a function `GetNextChangeEntryFromUser` that actually asks for the user's input about *what* they want to change. We ask them for a mission index followed by a request to provide some arbitrary robot id, retuning these as a pair of values.

`user_input.hpp`

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "mission_robot_assignments.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

inline bool CheckIfUserWantsChanges() {
  std::cout << "Do you want to change assignment? [y/n]" << std::endl;
  std::string answer{};
  std::cin >> answer;
  if (answer == "y") { return true; }
  return false;
}

// Multiple issues here for now.
// We should handle failure to get a proper value.
// We also could use a struct in place of a pair.
inline std::pair<int, int> GetNextChangeEntryFromUser(
    const MissionRobotAssignments& assignments) {
  std::pair<int, int> entry{};
  std::cout << "Please select mission index." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.first;
  std::cout << "Please provide new robot id." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.second;
  return entry;
}
```

Finally, we need a `main` function that prints the initial assignment and keeps asking the user for their input until they don't want to provide any. We end by printing the resulting assignments.

`robot_example.cpp`

```cpp
#include "mission_robot_assignments.hpp"
#include "user_input.hpp"
#include "types.hpp"

// Careful! The code below causes a subtle bug!
int main() {
  MissionRobotAssignments assignments{{Mission{42}, Mission{40}},
                                      {Robot{10}, Robot{23}}};
  assignments.Print();
  while (true) {
    const auto user_wants_changes = CheckIfUserWantsChanges();
    if (!user_wants_changes) { break; }
    const auto change_entry = GetNextChangeEntryFromUser(assignments);
    assignments.AssignRobot(change_entry.first, change_entry.second);
  }
  assignments.Print();
}
```

Obviously, this example does not do too much, but trust me it is good enough to illustrate many of the core concepts we are talking about today. I hope that with some minor stretch of imagination we can all imagine how it could be extended to a real-world use-case by adding a couple more functions.

Oh, and as always, there is [complete code](code/error_handling/robot_example_simple/robot_example.cpp) to this project.
<!-- You can find it linked below this video in the accompanying markdown script. -->

## Unrecoverable error example

Now with the example set up, we can illustrate what a typical unrecoverable error looks like.

An example run of this program might look something like this:

```output
0: Mission 42 is carried out by the robot 10
1: Mission 40 is carried out by the robot 23
Do you want to change assignment? [y/n]
y
Please select mission index.
40
Please provide new robot id.
4242
Do you want to change assignment? [y/n]
n
0: Mission 4242 is carried out by the robot 10
1: Mission 40 is carried out by the robot 23
```

Here, there are two assignments to start with and the user wants to change the assignment for missions 40 to a robot with an id 4242. However, if we look at the assignments printed in the end we see something strange there: the robots assigned to missions did not change at all! Instead, a mission id changed!

Essentially, due to our poor interface, the user got confused and instead of specifying the array index for a mission they wanted to change, they provided mission id. The code still uses that id as an index, writing the robot id that the user provided far beyond the expected memory address.

But why does it change the mission entry?

To get a hint about this, we can create an even simpler example by changing our `main` function:

```cpp
#include "mission_robot_assignments.hpp"
#include "types.hpp"

int main() {
  MissionRobotAssignments assignments{{Mission{42}, Mission{40}},
                                      {Robot{10}, Robot{23}}};
  std::cout << "Address of assignments.missions.data(): "
            << assignments.missions.data() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Address of assignments.robots.data(): "
            << assignments.robots.data() << std::endl;
  const auto diff = assignments.missions.data() - assignments.robots.data();
  std::cout << "Diff in address: " << diff << std::endl;
}
```

Running this code will output the addresses for the data stored within our assignments object and the difference between their addresses. If this is confusing, please feel free to refresh what [raw pointers](raw_pointers.md) are before going deeper into *this* topic.

```output
Address of assignments.missions.data(): 0x145605ea0
Address of assignments.robots.data(): 0x145605e00
Diff in address: 40
```

If we look long enough at the output of our code and remember that we used 40 as our mission id that we wanted to change, something starts to click!

Here's what happened: the program was asking us for a mission **index** but we provided a mission **id**. Then the id that the user provided got written into the `assignments.robots` vector way beyond the end of its memory and it "just so happened" that the address of the element we wrote to ended up having the address of the first element of the `assignments.missions`! So we overwrote the first element of our missions by mistake!

Do note, that we're hitting **undefined behavior** here! This result will almost certainly be different if you run it on your own machine! The addresses of the `assignments.robots` and `assignments.missions` vectors will be different and can even have a different order in memory. You might have already noticed that `assignments.robots` appears before `assignments.missions` in memory even though `assignments.robots` appears *after* `assignments.missions` in the `struct` declaration! If you'd like to understand a bit more about how these are allocated, we've covered this [in the lecture on how C++ allocates memory](memory_and_smart_pointers.md).

The main point I was trying to make here though is that now our memory is corrupted. This particular example was carefully constructed to overwrite an element of another vector, but if the user provides a different "mission id" the code will write the user-provided number to an arbitrary part of memory that belongs to our program, or will crash with a segmentation fault error if we hit memory that does not belong to us yet. What this means is that once an event like this has occurred, we do not have any guarantee on the consistency of the state of our program. Arbitrary objects might be corrupted and can behave in unpredictable ways from this point on without us being able to know about it.

This concept lies at the core of what makes this type of errors "unrecoverable". If the data we try to use for recovery is corrupted, we have no guarantees that any such recovery will succeed.

## How to deal with unrecoverable errors

### Catch them as early as possible

We often want to catch these types of errors as early as possible‚Äîand crash as early as possible‚Äîbefore any more damage is done.

### Don't use `assert`

A typical approach is to enforce contracts at function boundaries.

One way that is often recommended on the Internet is to use [`assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert.html) that can be found in the `<cassert>` include file. I'm not a fan of using `assert` as it has one super annoying flaw but due to how popular it is in many C++ tutorials, we'll have to go through this topic step by step.

Essentially, `assert` allows us to check any boolean condition passed into it:

```cpp
assert(2 + 2 == 4);
```

In our example, we could change the `AssignRobot` and `Print` methods of our `MissionRobotAssignments` class to perform the checks needed to avoid potential undefined behavior:

`mission_robot_assignments.hpp`

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "types.hpp"

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>


// This should be a class, using struct for simplicity.
struct MissionRobotAssignments {

  void AssignRobot(int assignment_index, const Robot& robot) {
    assert((assignment_index < robots.size()) && (assignment_index >= 0));
    robots[assignment_index] = robot;
  }

  void Print() const {
    assert(robots.size() == missions.size());
    for (auto i = 0UL; i < robots.size(); ++i) {
      std::cout << i << ": Mission " <<                      //
          missions[i] << " is carried out by the robot " <<  //
          robots[i] << std::endl;
    }
  }

  std::vector<Mission> missions{};
  std::vector<Robot> robots{};
};
```

Now, if we try to compile and run our example just as we did before we won't be able to hit the same undefined behavior as the assertion will trigger!

```output
0: Mission 42 is carried out by the robot 10
1: Mission 40 is carried out by the robot 23
Do you want to change assignment? [y/n]
y
Please select mission index.
40
Please provide new robot id.
4242
Assertion failed: ((assignment_index < robots.size()) && (assignment_index >= 0)), function AssignRobot, file mission_robot_assignments.hpp, line 14.
[1]    29732 abort      ./robot_example
```

So far so good, right? So what is that fatal flaw I've been talking about that makes me dislike `assert`? Well, you see, all `assert` statements get disabled when a macro `NDEBUG` is defined. This is a standard macro name that gets defined by default for most release builds. So essentially, `assert` does not protect us from undefined behavior in the code we actually deploy!

We can easily demonstrate that the `asserts` indeed get compiled out by adding `-DNDEBUG` flag to our compilation command:

```cmd
c++ -std=c++17 -DNDEBUG -o robot_example robot_example.cpp
```

Running our example *now* leads to the same undefined behavior we observed before as all of the assertions were compiled out.

### Use `CHECK` macro instead

Even as `assert` might not be a perfect tool for the job, the idea of checking the function pre-conditions is actually still a very good idea!

And there are better tools for this! My favorite method is to use the [`CHECK`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/logging#CHECK) macro that can be found in the [Abseil library](https://abseil.io/docs/). We can use it in the same way as we used `assert`:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "types.hpp"

#include <absl/log/check.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// This should be a class, using struct for simplicity.
struct MissionRobotAssignments {

  void AssignRobot(int assignment_index, const Robot& robot) {
    CHECK_LT(assignment_index, robots.size());
    CHECK_GE(assignment_index, 0);
    robots[assignment_index] = robot;
  }

  void Print() const {
    CHECK_EQ(robots.size(), missions.size());
    for (auto i = 0UL; i < robots.size(); ++i) {
      std::cout << i << ": Mission " <<                      //
          missions[i] << " is carried out by the robot " <<  //
          robots[i] << std::endl;
    }
  }

  std::vector<Mission> missions{};
  std::vector<Robot> robots{};
};
```

And the output is very similar with the main difference being that it also works in release builds!

The main concern that people have when using `CHECK` macros is performance as they stay in our code and do cost some time when our program runs. But I would say that the benefits far outweigh the costs, and, unless we've measured that we cannot allow the tiny performance hit in a particular place of our code, we should be free to use `CHECK` for safety.

All in all, at least in my book, `CHECK` is our main weapon against unrecoverable errors and the undefined behavior that they tend to cause.

<!-- Add an animation of showing UB land and CHECK kicking its ass -->

## How to minimize number of unrecoverable errors

Of course, we'd rather not have the bugs we're talking about here at all. In practice, we aim to keep the test coverage high for our code, ideally close to 100% line and branch coverage. In some industry, like automotive, aviation, or medical this is actually a requirement.

However, even the most rigorous checking does not guarantee that our program will not hit a `CHECK` failure in production. It does happen from time to time that a cosmic ray will hit our memory just right and flip a bit. We might not be able to detect this, but using `CHECK` rigorously increases our chances. Now, if the flipped bit causes some pre-condition to fail, our program will fail rather than continue running in an undefined state. But my main point here is that despite our best efforts we still need to be prepared for when our program crashes.

In safety-critical systems, we often isolate components into separate processes or even separate hardware units, with watchdogs that can trigger recovery actions if something crashes. This way we can have our cake and eat it at the same time: using `CHECK` minimizes the time-to-failure when a bug is encountered, while our fallback options keep the system safe as a whole even when certain components fail.

That being said, such design of a system as a whole is a large architecture topic in itself and is far beyond what I want to talk about today. In most non-safety-critical systems we do not need to think about these failure cases as deeply and we can usually just restart our program in case of a one-off failure. But, if you're interested in this topic, I've given an introductory lecture [on this topic](https://youtu.be/DtRktn4bVWg?si=DJuU8OjxtBcj5o2C) at the University of Bonn some years ago.

# Recoverable errors: **handle and proceed**

But not every error should instantly crash our program! Indeed, in our example, the original cause of the error is not a cosmic ray flipping bits of our memory, but a wrong user input!

The good thing about user inputs is that we can ask the user to correct these without crashing our program! The type of errors we encounter here can be called **recoverable errors**.

To talk about them, let us focus on the function `GetNextChangeEntryFromUser` from our example. Currently, there is no validation of what the user inputs but we absolutely can and should perform such validation!

As we design our program, we know that the input the mission index the user provides first must be within the bounds of the mission vector within our `assignments` object:

```cpp
// Multiple issues here for now.
// We should handle failure to get a proper value.
// We also could use a struct in place of a pair.
inline std::pair<int, int> GetNextChangeEntryFromUser(
    const MissionRobotAssignments& assignments) {
  std::pair<int, int> entry{};
  std::cout << "Please select mission index." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.first;  // <-- This value is NOT arbitrary!
  std::cout << "Please provide new robot id." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.second;
  return entry;
}
```

So we'd like to somehow know that something went wrong withing the `GetNextChangeEntryFromUser` function and recover from this.

Broadly speaking, we have two strategies of communicating failures like these that have emerged in C++ over the years:

1. **Return a special value from a function.**
2. Throw an **exception**.

We‚Äôll spend most of our time on the first one‚Äîbut let‚Äôs first spend some time and talk about throwing exceptions, and yes, why I think it might not be the best thing we could do. This is the time to get your pitchforks ready üòâ.

## Exceptions

### What exceptions are

Since C++98 we have a powerful machinery of exceptions at our disposal. An exception is essentially just an object of some type, typically derived from [`std::exception`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception.html) class. Such an exception holds the information about the underlying failure and can be "thrown" and "caught" within a C++ program.

In our example function, we could throw an object of `std::runtime_error` when the user inputs a wrong mission index:

```cpp
// Multiple issues here for now.
// We should handle failure to get a proper value.
// We also could use a struct in place of a pair.
inline std::pair<int, int> GetNextChangeEntryFromUser(
    const MissionRobotAssignments& assignments) {
  std::pair<int, int> entry{};
  std::cout << "Please select mission index." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.first;  // <-- This value is NOT arbitrary!
  if ((entry.first < 0) || (entry.first >= assignments.missions.size())) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Wrong mission index provided.");
  }
  std::cout << "Please provide new robot id." << std::endl;
  std::cin >> entry.second;
  return entry;
}
```

Throwing an exception will interrupt the normal function flow, destroy all objects allocated in the appropriate scope and will continue with the "exceptional flow" of the program to find a place where the thrown exception can be handled.

Speaking of handling exceptions, we can "catch" them anywhere upstream from the place they have been thrown from. As `std::exception` is just an object, it can be caught by value or by reference. When using exceptions, it is considered best practice to catch them by reference. In our case this is possible because `std::runtime_error` derives from `std::exception`:

```cpp
#include "mission_robot_assignments.hpp"
#include "user_input.hpp"
#include "types.hpp"

int main() {
  MissionRobotAssignments assignments{{Mission{42}, Mission{40}},
                                      {Robot{10}, Robot{23}}};
  assignments.Print();
  while (true) {
    const auto user_wants_changes = CheckIfUserWantsChanges();
    if (!user_wants_changes) { break; }
    try {
      const auto change_entry = GetNextChangeEntryFromUser(assignments);
      assignments.AssignRobot(change_entry.first, change_entry.second);
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
      std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << "\n";
      std::cerr << "Please try again.\n";
    }
  }
  assignments.Print();
}
```

Should we forget to catch an exception it bubbles up to the very top and terminates our program.

On paper, this looks very neat. But there are problems.

<!-- Old text below -->

### Exceptions are (sometimes) expensive

Exceptions typically [allocate memory on the heap](memory_and_smart_pointers.md#the-heap) when thrown, and rely on **R**un-**T**ime **T**ype **I**nformation ([RTTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information)) to propagate through the call stack. There is a [great talk by Andreas Weiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO0KVB-XIeE), my former colleague at BMW, that goes into a lot of detail how exactly exceptions behave. The talk is called "Exceptions demystified" and I urge you to give it a watch if you want to know *all* the details!

But long story short, both throwing and catching exceptions relies on mechanisms that work at runtime and therefore cost execution time.

Unfortunately, there are no guarantees on timing or performance of these operations. While in most common scenarios these operations run fast-enough, in real-time or safety-critical code, such unpredictability is unacceptable.

### Exceptions hide the error path

Exceptions also arguably make control flow harder to reason about. To quote Google C++ style sheet:

> Exceptions make the control flow of programs difficult to evaluate by looking at code: functions may return in places you don't expect. This causes maintainability and debugging difficulties.

Indeed, an error can propagate across many layers of calls before being caught. It‚Äôs easy to miss what a function might throw‚Äîespecially if documentation is incomplete or out of date (which it almost always is).

Furthermore, the language permits the use of generic catch blocks like `catch (...)` and these make things even more confusing. We end up catching *something*, but we no longer know what or who threw it at us! üò±

In our own example, if `GetAnswerFromLlm` throws an undocumented `std::logic_error` but we only expect `std::runtime_error`, we might miss important context or even crash anyway:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

std::string GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question) {
  const auto llm = GetLlmHandle();
  if (!llm) throw std::runtime_error("No network connection");
  return llm->GetAnswer(question);
}

int main() {
  try {
    const auto response = GetAnswerFromLlm("What‚Äôs the meaning of life?");
    std::cout << response << "\n";
  } catch (...) {
    // Not very helpful, is it?
    std::cerr << "Oops, something happened.\n";
  }
}
```

<img src="images/error.png.webp" alt="Video Thumbnail" align="right" width=30% style="margin: 0.5rem">

I believe that `catch(...)` and equivalent constructs are singlehandedly responsible for the absolute majority of the fun error messages that we can see all over the internet and have probably encountered ourselves multiple times.

### Exceptions are banned in many code bases

All of these issues led a lot of code bases to ban exceptions altogether. In 2019, isocpp.org did a [survey](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/CppDevSurvey-2018-02-summary.pdf) on this matter and found that about half the respondents could not use exceptions at least in part of their code bases.

My own experience aligns with these results - every serious project I‚Äôve worked on either banned exceptions completely, or avoided them in performance-critical paths. But then again, I did work in robotics and automotive for the majority of my career.

The problem of using exceptions with an acceptable overhead has quite vibrant discussions around it with even calls for re-imagining exceptions altogether as can be seen in this [wonderful talk by Herb Sutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARYP83yNAWk) from CppCon 2019 as well as his [corresponding paper](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0709r4.pdf) on this topic.

But until the C++ community figures out what to do we are stuck with many people being unable to use the default error handling mechanism in C++.

So what do we do?

## Returning errors explicitly can work better if done well

Now is a time to return to the other option we hinted at before: dealing with errors by returning a special value from a function.

I would way that there are three distinct ways of thinking about it.
Let's illustrate all of them on a function we've already looked at:

```cpp
std::string GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question);
```

We can:

1. Keep the return type, `std::string` in our case, but return a special **value** of this type
2. Return an **error code**, which would change the signature of the function to return `int` or a similar type instead:

    ```cpp
    int GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question, std::string& result);
    ```

3. Return a **different type** specifically designed to encode failure states alongside the actual return, like `std::optional<std::string>` which only holds a valid `std::string` in case of success.

I believe that the third option is the best out of these three, but let me explain why the first two are not cutting it, before going deeper into details.

### Returning a value indicating error does not always work üò±

There is a number of issues with returning a special value from a function without using a special return type. As an illustration, in our case, a na√Øve choice would be to return an empty string if there was no answer from the LLM, but what if we asked the LLM something along the lines of "read this file, return empty string when done"? An empty string *is* the valid response here! How do we distinguish this output from a failure?

```cpp
std::string GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question) {
  const auto llm = GetLlmHandle();
  if (!llm) return "";  // üò± Not a great idea!
  return llm->GetAnswer(question);
}
```

Similar cases can be constructed for most values we can come up with. In addition to that, there is no easy way to encode the *reason* for the failure - we do want to know if we failed due to a network timeout or due to an imminent AI world takeover. And a final nail in the coffin of this method is that it does not work at all for functions that return `void` for obvious reasons.

<!-- TODO: maybe don't mention void here? Optional also does not really work for it -->

### Returning an error code breaks "pure functions" üò±

Returning an error code instead solves at least a couple of these issues. It is fast and reliable and we can design our software with different error codes in mind so that the reason for the failure is also communicated to us. This is also still the prevalent way of handling errors in C and in some library that we can find in the wild, so there *is* some merit to this method.

However, if our function actually must return a value, the only way to use error codes is to change its return type to the type that our error codes have, like `int`, which forces us to provide an additional output parameter to our function, like `std::string& result` in our case:

```cpp
int GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question, std::string& result);
```

The main issue with this from my point of view is that it is clunky, mixes input/output in the signature, and limits functional composition. Consider how we would use this function:

```cpp
int main() {
    std::string response{};  // Can't be const!
    const auto success = GetAnswerFromLlm("What‚Äôs the meaning of life?", response);
    if (!success) {
      std::cerr << "Could not get the result from LLM\n";
      return 1;
    }
    std::cout << response << "\n";
}
```

In this code, we have to create an empty string before calling the `GetAnswerFromLlm` function. Furthermore this string cannot be `const`, which goes against everything we've been talking in this series until now.

On top of all this, nowadays, the compilers are able to perform Return Value Optimization (or [RVO](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision.html)) for values returned from a function and this functionality is limited for such input/output parameters.

So clearly, there are some issues with this method too. I believe it has its merits sometimes, but there has to be a reason for it and we must measure the performance well.

### Using `std::optional`: **a better way**

I believe that there *is* a better way. With C++17, we gained [`std::optional`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.html) with which we can express that a function ‚Äúmight return a value‚Äù if everything goes well:

```cpp
std::optional<std::string> GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question);
```

Now our function returns an object of a different type, `std::optional<std::string>` that we can use in an `if` statement to find out if it actually holds a value, which we can get to by calling its `value()` method or using a dereferencing operator `*` just like with pointers:

```cpp
int main() {
  const auto answer = GetAnswerFromLlm("What now?");
  if (answer.has_value()) return 1;
  std::cout << answer.value() << "\n";
  std::cout << *answer << "\n";  // Same as above.
}
```

The presence or absence of a value is encoded into the type itself. No more guessing. No more relying on magic return values or input/output arguments. And as always, we can always find more information about how to use it at [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.html).

### Using `std::expected`: **add context**

However, we might notice that `std::optional` only tells us that *something* went wrong, but not *what* went wrong. We're still interested in a reason!

Enter [`std::expected`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected.html), coming in C++23. And if you'd like to know what led to it being added to the language, give this [fantastic talk by Andrei Alexandrescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH4WBuE1BHI) a watch! It is one of my favorite talks ever! It is both informative and entertaining in an equal measure!

<!-- However, please do that after watching this video to the end so that YouTube still shows it to other people. -->

With `std::expected` we could do the same things we could with `std::optional` and more by changing our function accordingly:

```cpp
std::expected<std::string, std::string> GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question);
```

Essentially, `std::expected` holds one of two values of two potentially different types - an expected or an unexpected one. Now we can return either a valid result, or an error message:

```cpp
std::expected<std::string, std::string> GetAnswerFromLlm(const std::string& question) {
  const auto llm = GetLlmHandle();
  if (!llm) return std::unexpected("Cannot get LLM handle.");
  return llm->GetAnswer(question);
}
```

Using it is also quite neat:

```cpp
int main() {
  const auto answer = GetAnswerFromLlm("What now?");
  if (!answer.has_value()) {
    std::cerr << answer.error() << "\n";
    return 1;
  }
  std::cout << answer.value() << "\n";
}
```

This has all the benefits we mentioned before:

- The signature of our function clearly states that it might fail
- The error if it happens needs to be dealt with explicitly by the caller
- Everything happens in deterministic time with no unpredictable runtime overhead
- Works for functions returning `void` too

There is just one tiny issue that spoils our fun. As you've probably noticed, most of the things we covered until now targeted C++17, and `std::expected` is only available from C++23 on. But there is a solution to this: we can use [`tl::expected`](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected) as a drop-in replacement for code bases that don't yet adopt C++23.

## Performance Considerations for `std::optional` and `std::expected`

One final thing I want to talk about is performance considerations when using `std::optional` and `std::expected`.

### Error type size matters

Both `std::optional` and `std::expected` are implemented using [`union`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union.html)-like storage internally‚Äîmeaning the value and error share memory with the bigger type defining the amount of memory allocated. Note that we should not use `union` directly in our code, but a number of standard classes use it under the hood.

In the case of `std::optional` this does not play much of a difference, as the "error" type is a tiny `std::nullopt_t` type but for `std::expected`, the error type affects the size of the object‚Äîeven when we‚Äôre returning a success.

So this is something to avoid:

```cpp
// Bad idea, wasting memory üò±
std::expected<int, HugeErrorObject> SomeFunction();
```

Every return now has the size of the larger type. Don't do this!

<!-- TODO: Should I provide a good way of doing things? -->

### Return value optimization

There is also one quirk with how these types interact with the return value optimization and named return value optimization in C++. These topics are quite nuanced, but in general, the rule of thumb here is quite simple: we should prefer constructing the `std::expected` and `std::optional` objects in-place rather than creating a local variable first.

For more details, I'll refer you to a [short video by Jason Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yJk5yfdih0) on this.

## Summary

We went through quite some material today. We've looked at all the various kinds of ways to deal with errors happening in our (and somebody else's) code. As a short summary, I hope that I could convince you that these are some sane suggestions:

<!-- TODO: Maybe summarize all the options we covered with quick overview of what to use? -->

- Use `CHECK` and similar macros for dealing with unrecoverable errors like programming bugs or contract violation.
- Use `std::optional` as a return type when a value might be missing due to a recoverable error occurring.
- Use `std::expected` when a reason for failure is important to know.
- Keep the test coverage of the code high to reduce chances of missing errors.
- Avoid exceptions in time-critical or safety-critical systems due to their non-deterministic runtime overhead.

All in all, the overall direction that we seem to be following as a community is to make failure explicit and force the caller to handle it. That leads to clearer, safer, and more maintainable code.

One final thing I wanted to add is that obviously, the `std::optional` class can be used also in other places, not just as a return type from a function. If some object of ours must have an optional value, using `std::optional` can be a good idea there too! But I'm sure you're going to be able to figure this out from the related [cppreference page](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.html).
