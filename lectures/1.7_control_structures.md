Style (üé®) and software design (üéì) recommendations mostly come from [Google Style Sheet](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and the [CppCoreGuidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)

# If statement
```cpp
if (STATEMENT) {
  // This is executed if STATEMENT == true
} else if (OTHER_STATEMENT) {
  // This is executed if:
  // (STATEMENT == false) && (OTHER_STATEMENT == true)
} else {
  // This is executed if neither is true
}
```
- Used to conditionally execute code
- All the `else` cases can be omitted if needed
- `STATEMENT` can be **any boolean expression**


---
# Switch statement
```cpp
switch(STATEMENT) {
  case CONST_1:
    // This runs if STATEMENT == CONST_1.
    break;
  case CONST_2:
    // This runs if STATEMENT == CONST_2.
    break;
  default:
    // This runs if no other options worked.
}
```
- Used to conditionally execute code
- Can have many `case` statements
- `break` exits the `switch` block
- `STATEMENT` usually returns `int` or `enum` value

---
# While loop
```cpp
while (STATEMENT) {
  // Loop while STATEMENT == true.
}
```
- Example `while` loop:
```cpp
bool condition = true;
while (condition) {
  condition = GetRandomBool();
}
```
- Usually used when the exact number of iterations is unknown before-wise
- Easy to form an endless loop by mistake

---
# For loop
```cpp
for (INITIAL_CONDITION; END_CONDITION; INCREMENT) {
  // This happens until END_CONDITION == false
}
```
- Example `for` loop:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < COUNT; ++i) {
  // This happens COUNT times.
}
```
- In C++ `for` loops are _very_ fast. Use them!
- Less flexible than `while` but less error-prone
- Use `for` when number of iterations is fixed and `while` otherwise

---
# Range for loop
- Iterating over a standard containers like 
  `std::array` or `std::vector` has simpler syntax
- Avoid mistakes with indices
- Show intent with the syntax
- Has been added in C++11
```cpp
for (const auto& value : container) {
  // This happens for each value in the container.
}
```

---
# Exit loops and iterations
- We have control over loop iterations
- Use `break` to exit the loop
- Use `continue` to skip to next iteration
```cpp
while (true) {
  int i = GetRandomInt();
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    cerr << i << endl;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
```
