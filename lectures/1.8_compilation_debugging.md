# Control structures

#### Today:
- `if` statements and ternary operator
- Loops: `for` and `while`

# Special symbols used in slides
- 🎨 - Style recommendation
- 🎓 - Software design recommendation
- 😱 - **Not** a good practice! Avoid in real life!
- ✅ - Good practice!
- ❌ - Whatever is marked with this is wrong
- 🚨 - Alert! Important information!
- 💡 - Hint or a useful exercise
- 🔼1️⃣7️⃣ - Holds for this version of C++(here, `17`) and **above**
- 🔽1️⃣1️⃣ - Holds for versions **until** this one C++(here, `11`)

Style (🎨) and software design (🎓) recommendations mostly come from [Google Style Sheet](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and the [CppCoreGuidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)

# Compilation flags
- Lots of flags can be passed while compiling the code
- We have seen some already: `-std=c++17`, `-o`, etc.
  ```cpp
  c++ -std=c++17 -o test test.cpp
  ```
### Other useful options:
- ✅ Enable **all** warnings, treat them as errors: 
  `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Wpedantic`, `-Werror`
- Optimization options:
  - `-O0` - no optimization
  - `-O3` - full optimization
- Keep debugging symbols: `-g` (use with `-O0`)
- :bulb: Play with it using Compiler Explorer: https://godbolt.org/

# Debugging your code
- Debugging **will** take more time than writing your code
- :bulb: Read about [how to think about debugging](https://github.com/kmille/linux-debugging/blob/1e863038859420a50e2ebe3e7e18362aa70e8f57/mindset.md) (**really**, do it!)
- When it comes to tools used for debugging, 
  there are largely two different philosophies:
  - Using **print** statements `[my preference]`
  - Using a **debugger**
- Each has advantages and disadvantages
- No debugging methods is complete without you thinking about the **probable cause of the problem**
- You can read [a discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26925570) on Hacker News about it

# Using print statements
- Just add any printout statements to your code
- I usually use a form of a print statement shown below:
    ```cpp
    std::cerr << __FILE__ << ":" << __LINE__ << std::endl;
    ```
- This will print the filename and a line where its called
- We can also print the value of interest at any point
- Usually requires to recompile only part of the program
- Requires us to:
  - Observe the behavior
  - Form a hypothesis of what is wrong
  - Try a fix and repeat until problem is solved

# Using a debugger
- Allows stopping a program at a point and looking around
- Requires **debug symbols** (`-g` flag), needs full recompilation
- Might be confusing with optimizations enabled
- The best program to use is probably `gdb`
- Insanely popular and powerful (and already installed :wink:)
- Allows to print the **backtrace**
- No built-in gui :cry:
- There are some tools built on top of GDB to fix this:
  - [`gdbgui`](https://gdbgui.com/) is a Python tool that provides a web GUI for GDB
  - VSCode C++ extension uses gdb under the hood for its debugger
