# Value semantics

If you heard anything about modern C++, you've probably heard these words: value semantics, move semantics, rvalues, lvalues, rvalue references, rrefs etc.

The concepts behind these words form the foundational principles behind Modern C++ as we know it.

However, for various reasons these concepts are *very* confusing to *a lot* of people! I've seen people being scared of these things, treating them like magic, and having a lot of misunderstandings along the way. Navigating these waters effortlessly is a must for being able to design great software.

So, today I'm here to tell you - **there is no black magic!** We're going to dive deep into value semantics and see how it all makes sense using the concepts that we already know from the previous videos, mostly references and function overloading!

Actually, to build a better understanding, we're about to start with "why" and design the value semantics mechanism from scratch.

<!-- Intro -->

## Why we care about value semantics
So, in the spirit of "starting with why", I want us to start with an example that will illustrate why we need value semantics.

### Setting up the example to illustrate why we need value semantics
But first we need to set the stage. Please bear with me.

Imagine that we have [a custom type](classes_intro.md) `HugeObject` that owns some *big* chunk of memory. It allocates this memory using some magic function `std::byte* AllocateMemory(std::size_t length)` on creation and frees this memory using another magic function `FreeMemory(std::byte* ptr)` when it dies.
```cpp
// üò± Please don't do this in real code, for illustration purposes only!
// üí° We will talk about how to properly allocate and free memory later!
std::byte *AllocateMemory(std::size_t length) { return new std::byte[length]; }
void FreeMemory(std::byte *ptr) { delete[] ptr; }
```
At this point it is not important how exactly that happens we just have to remember that allocating, copying and freeing memory are all time-wise costly operations.

We also want to be able to assign another `HugeObject` to our current object after creation for the sake of this example, so we also add an "assignment operator" to it. This operator is just a function with a certain signature that takes a reference to a `HugeObject` as an input and copies this incoming object's data into the current instance. You can think of such an operator as being just a function with a funky name.

> :bulb: :scream: Note that this struct does not follow good style, but it is useful to us to illustrate the concept of value semantics. There are important parts of this class missing, like some constructors, operators etc., so don't copy this code blindly.

```cpp
struct HugeObject {
  HugeObject() = default;

  explicit HugeObject(std::size_t data_length)
      : length{data_length}, data_ptr{AllocateMemory(length)} {}

  // Think of it as just a function with a funky name.
  HugeObject &operator=(const HugeObject &object) {
    if (this == &object) { return *this; }  // Do not self-assign.
    FreeMemory(data_ptr);  // In case we already owned some memory from before.
    length = object.length;
    data_ptr = AllocateMemory(length);
    std::copy(object.data_ptr, object.data_ptr + length, data_ptr);
    return *this;
  }

  ~HugeObject() { FreeMemory(data_ptr); }

  std::size_t length{};
  std::byte *ptr{};
};
```

And let's say we also have a struct `HugeObjectStorage` that holds a `HugeObject` instance as a `member_object`. And in the `main` function we put an existing `HugeObject` into a `HugeObjectStorage` object:
```cpp
struct HugeObjectStorage {
  HugeObject member_object;
};

int main() {
  HugeObject object{100};
  HugeObjectStorage storage{};
  storage.member_object = object;
  return 0;
}
```
Let's quickly talk about what happens here:
- We create an `object` in the `main` function scope (‚ö†Ô∏è costly)
- We create an empty `member_object` for the `storage` object (‚úÖ cheap)
- We copy the data from `object` to `member_object` (‚ö†Ô∏è costly)

## We're ready to figure out what value semantics is for!
At this point, we might observe that we actually **do not use `object` after it is set to `member_object`**! But both objects are still maintained and the data is fully copied. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to "steal" the data from `object` and give it to `member_object` if we know that `object` will not use these data anymore?

This question is at the heart of why value semantics exists! The only reason it exists is to make such a use-case more efficient and to enable **ownership transfer** in addition to copying and borrowing the data.

Some of you might ask a question - why do we need to copy the data? Why can't we just set the `member_object.ptr` to point to the same memory as `object.ptr` instead? We will talk about this more in the future, but the gist of it is that then the memory will be freed twice, which is not allowed and will cause a runtime error.

## What does it mean to "steal" the data from an object?
<!-- Illustrate with animation -->
So, we want to be able to steal the data. But what does it even mean to "steal" the data? Well, essentially, it only really makes sense in the context of pointers. If we have a pointer `a` that points to some address `0x42424242` in memory and a pointer `b` "steals" its data it means that at the end of this operation the following is true:
- Data stays where it was **with no modification**
- Pointer `a` is set to `nullptr`
- Pointer `b` is set to point to `0x42424242` address

The emphasis here is on the need to modify the pointer that we steal from!

If we want to implement this behavior in our existing assignment operator we can't! :shrug: Our assignment operator takes a `const` reference which makes it impossible to modify the underlying object!

## Na√Øve implementation of "stealing"
That is, however, easy enough to fix. Let's just forget everything that we talked about passing objects into functions for a second and just remove the `const` :wink:. This allows us to change the incoming object, so let's now change the logic from "copying" to "stealing":
```cpp
// üò± This is not a good practice and is only here for illustrating purposes
HugeObject &operator=(HugeObject &object) {
  if (this == &object) { return *this; }  // Do not self-assign.
  FreeMemory(ptr);  // In case we already owned some memory from before.
  length = object.length;
  ptr = object.ptr;
  object.ptr = nullptr;  // Essential for "stealing"!
  return *this;
}
```

Great! Now, after running our main function again, this happens:
- We create an `object` in the `main` function scope (‚ö†Ô∏è costly)
- We create an empty `member_object` for the `storage` object (‚úÖ cheap)
- We **steal** the data from `object` and set it to `member_object` (‚úÖ cheap)

Stop for a second to admire what we've done! This is essentially how we can steal resources without copying! If we have huge data stored under some pointer, stealing will be much quicker than copying! And if you ever heard phrases like "we move these data" this is what it is about! We've just "moved" one object into another.

## Problems with the na√Øve solution
However, the reality is not as simple. While we *did* achieve what we wanted in this small example, we've made a pretty terrible decision. There is now no more way to do the following:
- We cannot copy the data anymore üòê. Sometimes we still might want to! We can only steal now.
- We cannot pass a temporary object anymore! This won't work!
  ```cpp
  storage.member_object = HugeObject{200};  // ‚ùå Does not compile.
  ```
  The reason for this is that we can't bind a non-const reference to a temporary object (try it yourselves to see an error)

So the question is - how can we have our cake and eat it at the same time? We will have to extend our language for this (which is exactly what happened with C++11).

## Better solution - add a new reference type to the language!
If we agree to add new things to the language, the answer to our problem is genius in its simplicity - we just invent a new type that means "reference that can be stolen from"!

This enables us to just write a different assignment operator overload for this type. Given any type, `HugeObject` in our case, we have a reference type for it: `HugeObject&`. By analogy, let's name our new type `HugeObject&&` and define it as such that it can bind to temporary objects or those that we are allowed to steal from. So writing something like this should be possible:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int&& answer = 42;
  answer++;
  std::cout << answer << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

With such a type at hand we can rewrite our original code adding an overload of our assignment operator on this new `&&` reference type:
```cpp
struct HugeObject {
  HugeObject() = default;

  explicit HugeObject(std::size_t data_length)
      : length{data_length}, ptr{AllocateMemory(length)} {}

  HugeObject &operator=(const HugeObject &object) {
    if (this == &object) { return *this; }  // Do not self-assign.
    FreeMemory(ptr);  // In case we already owned some memory from before.
    length = object.length;
    ptr = AllocateMemory(length);
    std::copy(object.ptr.begin(), object.ptr.begin() + length, ptr.begin());
    return *this;
  }

  HugeObject &operator=(HugeObject &&object) {
    if (this == &object) { return *this; }  // Do not steal from ourselves.
    FreeMemory(ptr);  // In case we already owned some memory from before.
    length = object.length;
    ptr = object.ptr;
    object.ptr = nullptr;
    return *this;
  }

  ~HugeObject() { FreeMemory(ptr); }

  std::size_t length{};
  std::byte *ptr{};
};
```

## We also design how the `&&` references are created
Now we just need to design how our new `&&` reference type is created from various objects and we are done! We care about two use cases - passing temporary objects like `HugeObject{}` and passing objects that we as programmers know will not be in use anymore and so can be stolen from.
- For temporary objects we can postulate that they always pick the `&&` reference overload
- For the objects not in use anymore, as this is up to us to decide, we will have a function that converts any object into its `&&` reference. We could call this function `CanBeStolenFrom(object)` but in reality, in modern C++ this function has a name `std::move(object)`. It does not have to actually *do* anything but to cast the type as an indication that the resources of this object can be stolen. We will skip the actual implementation here as it is not important to understand the concept.

This all enables us to write the code like this:
```cpp
int main() {
  HugeObject object{100};
  HugeObjectStorage storage{};
  storage.member_object = object;
  storage.member_object = HugeObject{200};
  storage.member_object = std::move(object);
  return 0;
}
```
All of the behaviors from before are present here!
- We copy `object` into `member_object`
- We move a temporary `HugeObject{200}` into `member_object`
- We move the `object` into `member_object`

## Yay! We've reinvented value semantics!
That is it! Conceptually, we've just invented the whole thing that is called value semantics in modern C++! At this point, it should be pretty clear what happens under the hood and why we need all of this. There is a couple of things that logically follow from what we've just done:
- Moving objects only makes sense if they own some resource through a pointer. All the other data is simply copied over, yielding no benefit.
- We should never use the object that has been "moved from" as its resources are in some undefined but valid state.

## How is it actually done in Modern C++?
One final thing before we close here. Let's return from our fairyland back to reality and make sure we are aligned with how things actually are in Modern C++. Our definition of this new type of reference was a bit hand-wavy, C++ standard of course defines things much more strictly. Largely speaking there are a couple of different **kinds** of values:
- `lvalues` - historically anything that could be found on the left of the `=` operator. Nowadays, anything that has a name and an address in memory
- `prvalue` - maps most precisely to what we called a "temporary" before. Does not have a name and a permanent address in memory and usually cannot appear on the left of the `=` operation
- `xvalues` - so-called e**X**piring values: `lvalues` after `std::move`, i.e., those whose resources can be stolen
- `rvalues` - historically everything that is not an `lvalue`, nowadays, either an `xvalue` or an `prvalue`.

The value categories are quite nuanced in C++, but you should now be prepared to be able to read them on the [related page of the cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category) :wink:

The `&&` reference that we (and the authors of C++11 standard) have invented is usually referred to as an `rref` because it is a `ref` that binds to things that are `rvalues` and so it is a shortcut for "rvalue reference".

There is also one important quirk of `rrefs` to be aware of. If we store an `rref` into a variable, **it is an `lvalue` and not an `rvalue`**! So by default such a value, when passed to a function, will choose the "lvalue reference" overload! This means that we have to use `std::move` on a named `rref` in order to choose a correct `rref` overload. It might sound a bit confusing, so let me illustrate:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void Blah(int&&) {
  std::cout << "rvalue reference" << std::endl;
}

void Blah(int&) {
  std::cout << "lvalue reference" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int&& answer = 42;  // answer is an lvalue that stores an rvalue reference!
  Blah(answer);  // Prints "rvalue reference"
  Blah(std::move(answer));  // Prints "lvalue reference"
  return 0;
}
```

## That's all folks!
Now we really know everything there is to know about value semantics. We can now transfer ownership of objects by moving the data as opposed to copying or borrowing them and hopefully by this time we are all on the same page that the whole thing is **not black magic** and is nothing else than a piece of clever and elegant engineering.
